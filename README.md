# hyper-rest-client Planning

## Phase 1

- Study C Programming Language, one of the languages that will be use in this project.
- Study and produce samples using Linux/Unix System Operating API regarding Networking Programming.

## Phase 2

- Study C++ Language
- Study how to produce static and dynamic libraries.
- Design and implement the library hyper-net0 that must contain pure functions in C language.
- Design a solution to test the library, using integration test.

## Phase 3

- Design and implement hyper-netpp that must contain a small layer using C++ doing call to hyper-net0.
  Application using C++ can use hyper-net0 directly but better to use hyper-netpp
- Design and implement a JSON parser.
- Design and implement the hyper-rest-client library able to call HTTP GET, POST, PUT methods, parse JSON, and required 
  common features required for REST consume apps.
- Design and implement integration test for hyper-rest-client
